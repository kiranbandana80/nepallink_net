                        the Customer prior to the renewal date. Cancellations must be submitted

                        consequential damages to the Customer for the interruption in service.
                        Failure to pay includes expired, declined, and inactive credit cards,

                        files. NepalLink does, however, perform daily backups of server
                        configurations and customer data. In the event of data loss due to any
                        fault of the Customer, and a restore is necessary using NepalLink's
                        backups, Customer agrees to pay NepalLink a technical support fee to recover Customer's lost data.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
                        NepalLink expressly limits its damages to the Customer for any down
                        time to the pro-rated hosting cost during the time of system
                        unavailability. NepalLink specifically denies any responsibilities for

                      Any site found to host pornography or linking to pornography will be suspended immediately without notice.<br>

                      <br>
                      We will suspend the site in question and will notify you so you may terminate the account. We will further monitor your activity; more than one infraction of this type may result in the immediate termination of your account.<br>
                      <br>

                      Violations will be reported to the appropriate law enforcement agency.<br>
                      <br>
                      It is your responsibility to ensure that scripts/programs installed under your account are secure and permissions of directories are set properly, regardless of installation method. When at all possible, set permissions on most directories to 755 or as restrictive as possible. Users are ultimately responsible for all actions taken under their account. This includes the compromise of credentials such as user name and password. It is required that you use a secure password. If a weak password is used, your account may be suspended until you agree to use a more secure password. Audits may be done to prevent weak passwords from being used. If an audit is performed, and your password is found to be weak, we will notify you and allow time for you to change/update your password.<br>

                      </li>
                      <li><strong>Resource Abuse Policy (RAP)<br>
                        <br>
                      </strong>Any website on our shared servers that uses a high amount of server resources (CPU, memory usage, and network resources) will be given an option to pay for a dedicated server. The abuse and misuse of system resources is a serious problem, and NepalLink does not tolerate it. Accounts on a shared server must be shared with other users, so we must limit how much of the CPU and memory that can be used by any one account.<br>
                        <br>
                        In all fairness, we cannot allow one or two clients to use all of the system resources on a shared machine and have all other clients suffer because of it. Excessive CPU &amp; memory usage by one or more clients causes extreme slowness in all areas: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Email, HTTP and more. If the CPU &amp; memory usage by a few clients gets out of hand, all sites hosted on the machine will return errors and not be accessible in any way.<br>
                        <br>
                        AVERAGE SERVER RESOURCE LIMITS<br>
                        Memory usage may not exceed 10% per domain/file/application<br>
                        CPU usage may not exceed 20% per domain/file/application<br>
                        Apache connections may not exceed 30 connections<br>
                        15 MySQL maximum user connections allowed<br>
                        300 emails per day, per domain<br>
                        <br>
                        There are special exceptions to these rules to be determined at the time we discover abuse. There are different combinations of usage that can create problems and other special cases. At any given time a server is unstable and an account is found to be the cause, we reserve the right to suspend the account to keep the server online and operating normally. If the usage is an increasing trend, we recommend the user invest in a dedicated server so the website can grow at a normal rate without restriction.<br>

                      <li><strong> Free Hosting Sites</strong><br>
                        <br>
                        NepalLink believes in the freedom of hosting. We do allow our users to run Free Hosting sites, though for having lots abuses and resources delegation NepalLink reserves the rights to set a limit over an account if abuse department approves the account as a &ldquo;FREE HOSTING PROVIDER&rdquo;. Usually for a free hosting provider a 20 domains limit is eligible if and only if the provider is a TLD Free domain hosting provider, if the provider is a subdomain hosting (FREE) then the limit is set to 10 domains usually. We do not block free hosting services like other hosting providers though, for abuse and resource limitation on a premium server this policy is applied.<br>

                        <br>
                      This Agreement may be terminated by either Customer or NepalLink at any
                      time without prior notice and without cause. However, NepalLink will
                      attempt to provide sufficient advance notice whenever possible should
                      termination be necessary. Unused portions of service will be prorated
                      and refunded on request ONLY if the following conditions are met:<br>
                      Customer has made at least two hosting payments.<br>
                      <br>
                      There are at least 15 days remaining in the current billing period on
                      the date Customer requests pro-rated refund.<br>
                      <br>
                      If both of these conditions are not met, hosting services are
                      terminated at the end of the current billing period and no refund will

                      Customer's responsibility to point their domain and transfer their data
                      to another hosting provider upon discontinuation of service.<br>

                        Customer agrees that it shall defend, indemnify, save and hold harmless
                        from any and all demands, liabilities, losses, costs, claims, including

                        result from any services provided, performed or agreed to be performed.
                        Customer agrees that use of NepalLink's servers is at Customer's sole
                        risk. Neither NepalLink, its employees, agents, resellers, or the like

                        Due to the public nature of the Internet, NepalLink is not liable for

                      <li><strong>Password Reset <br>
                        <br>
                      </strong>All accounts on our web servers are subject to the Account Password Reset Policy as described in this document. Under this Password Reset Policy, your placement of information on our servers is an acknowledgement that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by terms and conditions below.<br>
                        <br>
                      i. Password Reset Procedure<br>
                        <br>
                        Customer will need to send Account Password Reset Request via authorized email to initialize the password reset process. Once we received the request, we will verify the customer account status. Only request from the registered customer email account in our database will be processed. This is for security purpose. We DO NOT accept password reset requests over the phone. Only a fully completed formal request via email or faxed copy of the password reset form will be entertained.<br>
                          <br>Nepallink's reserves the right to reject or disapprove any customer password reset request based on our sole discretion.<br>
                          <br>
                      ii. Modification of Password reset policy<br>
                      <br>Nepalink reserves the right to change the terms, conditions, and notices under which this policy is written. No prior notice may be given.<br>
                      <br>
                      iii. General Information<br>
                      <br>
                      The Password Reset Policy constitute the entire agreement between you and Nepallink and govern your use of the Service, superceding any prior agreements between you and Nepallink. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate or other Nepallink services, third-party contents or third-party software.<br>
                      <br>
                      </li>
                      <li><strong>Script Usage Policy<br>
                        <br>
                      </strong>i. The script must use low system resources. Scripts that consume a large amount of our RAM or processor will be subject to immediate suspension until the owner can be notified and an alternative solution is reached.<br>
                        <br>
ii. Each user account may not use more than 20% of system resources at any given time. If an account is consistently using 20% or greater system resources, the account holder will be warned and if no action is taken on behalf of the account holder the account may be suspended.<br>
<br>
iii. The scripts may not interact with any server configuration or hardware. Accounts running these scripts are subject to immediate account termination without refund.<br>
<br>
iv. The script can not be used or referenced from any other site not hosted by Nepallink.<br>
<br>
v. The script must execute in a timely fashion. Any script that uses the processor for more than a few milliseconds is subject to removal.<br>
<br>
vi. Any script that appears to be designed specifically to attack or otherwise maliciously affect the server is completely unacceptable, and if such scripts are found in your account the account will be terminated immediately and your actions will be reported to the proper local, state, and federal authorities and legal action will be taken to prosecute the account holder to the fullest extent of the law by NepalLink.<br>
<br>
vii. Perl/Php/python or any script based chat room scripts are strictly prohibited.<br>
<br>
viii. Scripts that require high-bandwidth usage, such as chat room scripts or banner rotation scripts, will be allowed to run only on our high-end accounts.<br>
<br>
ix. Scripts must be kept secure. Unnecessary chmoding scripts to 777 is a violation of this policy. Keeping scripts in a publicly viewable directory (one without a index.html file) is also in violation of this policy. NOTE: If a script will NOT execute with a permission other than 777 (rarely the case) you may contact customer care to get approval for the script which will be given under most circumstances.<br>
                      <br>
                      Any accounts with scripts found in violation of these policies are subject to future scrutiny of all CGI, Perl, CFM, ASP, ASP.NET, Python, Ruby and PHP scripts by our System Administrators. If a script is found to be harmful to the system, it will be killed immediately and the account locked down until the account owners have been contacted. Malicious scripts are subject to immediate account termination without refund of any pre-paid monies.<br>

In no event shall NepalLink be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special and exemplary damages, or any damages whatsoever, arising from the use or performance of this web site or from any information, services or products provided through your web site.

                      <li><strong>Refusal of Service<br>
                      </strong><br>
                        We reserve the right to refuse, cancel, or suspend service at our sole discretion. An example of refusal of service is if an account continues to abuse our policies after warnings. Refusal, cancellation or suspension of services especially holds true to issues with spam or any script abuse. Another example of refusal of service is if a customer becomes very unreasonable, unprofessional, extremely difficult to work with or threatening. Said customer&rsquo;s account will be suspended and we will recommend to the customer to find a new host. A backup of the account(s) will be provided.<br>

                      the law of EU, US or Nepal. In the event that any portion of this Agreement is

                      original intentions of the parties and the remainder of the provisions
                      shall remain in full force and effect.<br>
