                    <p>Nepallink agrees to furnish services to the subscriber of services (&quot;Client&quot;), subject to the following VPS TOS (&quot;Virtual Private Server Terms of Service&quot;).</p>
                    <p>Nepallink reserves the right to change this VPS TOS at any time. Such changes, modifications, additions or deletions shall be effective immediately upon posting on-line at this location. You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to review this site and this VPS TOS periodically and to be aware of any modifications. You may identify whether Nepallink has revised this VPS TOS by noting the &quot;Effective Date&quot; above. Your continued use of the services after such modifications will constitute your: (a) acknowledgment of the modified VPS TOS; and (b) agreement to abide and be bound by the modified VPS TOS. If you do not agree to these terms, please contact us to cancel your services.</p>
                    <p>The use of  VPS services from NepalLink constitutes an agreement  by the customer  to the terms outlined below.</p>
                    <p><strong>1. Term</strong></p>
                    <p>The initial  service term of  the agreement  shall  begin on the date that  NepalLink Network (hereby 
                      NepalLink)  generates  an  e-mail  message  announcing  the  activation  of  the  account  (the  &quot;Service 
                      Commencement Date&quot;) and shall continue either monthly , six months or annually depending on the 
                      term picked by the customer.  Upon expiration of  the initial  term,  this agreement  shall  automatically 
                      become null  and void.  The initial  term and any renewal  term may be referred to collectively in this 
                      agreement as the &quot;Term.&quot;</p>
                    <p><strong>2. Cancellation &amp; Refunds</strong></p>
                    <p>NepalLink reserves the right to cancel any service provided with a prior notification of 90 days. In this 
                      event customers will be entitled to a prorated refund based upon the remaining period of service. If a 
                      customer  contravenes NepalLink 's terms of  service,  a refund will  not  be issued in the event  of  a 
                      cancellation by NepalLink or  the customer.  Any incentives offered to customers when opening the 
                      account will also be cancelled. Customers may be given the option to purchase services which were 
                      offered as start-up incentives in the result of a cancellation. Fees charged on a prepay basis are nonrefundable. Under no circumstance will license fees such as cPanel/Plesk be refunded.</p>
                    <p><strong>3. Content Restrictions</strong><br>
                      <br>
                      NepalLink does not allow the use of its services for illegal activities. This includes hosting of copyrighted 
                      material, nulled scripts, or anything that is considered illegal under US law. A suspension leading up to 
                      termination will be imposed for a breach of these terms. While we strive to accommodate all types of 
                      customers your VPS may not be used for the following:<br>
                      <br>
                      Bittorrent Trackers<br>
                      Sending of unsolicited Email (SPAM)<br>
                      Anything related to a botnet<br>
                      Downloading Torrents<br>
                      Hosting of illegal or copyrighted files<br>
                      <br>
                      Furthermore  the  end  user  is  solely  responsible  for  all  files  on  their  VPS whether  the  client  had 
                      knowledge of the files or not. It is the responsibility of the client to ensure their system is secured and 
                      safe from compromise. If a system is found out to be compromised NepalLink has the right to reload the 
                      VPS to a default OS after ample time has been given to make backups.<br>
                      <br>
                      <strong>                      4. Payments</strong><br>
                      <br>
                      Fees are payable in advance on the first  day of  each billing cycle.  Customer's billing cycle shall  be 
                      monthly, six months or annually as indicated on their order, beginning on the service commencement 
                      date. NepalLink may require payment for the first billing cycle before beginning service.  
                      Payments must  be made in Nepali Rs.  NepalLink may suspend the service with a prior notice of  10 
                      days if  payment  for the service is overdue. Fees not  disputed within sixty (60) days of due date are<br>
                      conclusively deemed accurate. <br>
                      <br>
                      <strong>Fee Increases: </strong>Nepallink shall not increase the fee amount till the service contract period. 
                      Early Termination:Customer  acknowledges  that  the amount  of  the fee for  the service is based on 
                      customer's agreement to pay the fee for the entire initial term, or renewal term, as applicable. In the 
                      event NepalLink terminates the agreement for customer's breach of the agreement in accordance with 
                      Section 10 (Termination), or customer terminates the service other than in accordance with Section 10 
                      (Termination) for NepalLink 's breach, the unpaid fees for each billing cycle remaining in the initial term 
                      or then-current renewal term, as applicable, are due on the business day following termination of the 
                      Agreement.<br>
                      <br>
                      <strong>5. Law/AUP</strong><br>
                      <br>
                      Customer agrees to use the service in compliance with applicable law and NepalLink 's Acceptable Use 
                      Policy posted at http://NepalLink.com/aup.php (the &quot;AUP&quot;), which is hereby incorporated by reference in 
                      this  agreement.  Customer  agrees  that  NepalLink  may,  in  its  reasonable  commercial  judgment 
                      consistent  with industry standards,  amend the AUP from time to time to further  detail  or  describe 
                      reasonable restrictions and conditions on customer's use of the services. Amendments to the AUP are 
                      effective on the earlier of NepalLink 's notice to the customer that an amendment has been made, or<br>
                      the first day of any renewal term that begins subsequent to the amendment.   The amendment in AUP 
                      should be notified thirty days (30) before to the customer. Customer agrees to cooperate with NepalLink 
                      's reasonable investigation of any suspected violation of the AUP. In the event of a dispute between 
                      NepalLink  and  the  customer  regarding  the  interpretation  of  the  AUP,  NepalLink  's  commercially  
                      reasonable interpretation of the AUP shall govern.<br>
                      <br>
                      <strong>6. Customer Information</strong><br>
                      <br>
                      Customer represents and warrants to NepalLink that the information he, she or it has provided and will 
                      provide  to  NepalLink  for  purposes  of  establishing  and maintaining  the  service  is  accurate.  If  the 
                      customer is an individual, the customer represents and warrants to NepalLink that he or she is at least 
                      18 years of age. NepalLink may rely on the instructions of the person listed as the primary customer

                      changing the primary customer contact.<br>
                      <br>
                      <strong>7. Indemnification</strong><br>
                      <br>
                      Customer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless NepalLink , NepalLink 's affiliates, and each of their

                      customer's log on information,  regardless of  whether  such person has been authorized to use the 
                      services by customer.<br>
                      <br>
                      <strong>8. Disclaimer of Warranties</strong><br>
                      <br>
                      NEPALLINK  DOES  NOT  WARRANT  OR  REPRESENT  THAT  THE  SERVICES  WILL  BE

                      <strong>9. Limitation of Damages</strong><br>
                      <br>
                      NEITHER  PARTY  SHALL  BE  LIABLE  TO THE  OTHER  FOR  ANY  LOST  PROFITS,  OR  ANY 
                      INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY 
                      KIND, OR FOR DAMAGES THAT COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED BY THE USE OF REASONABLE 
                      DILIGENCE, ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THE AGREEMENT, EVEN IF THE PARTY HAS BEEN<br>
                      ADVISED  OR  SHOULD  BE  AWARE  OF  THE  POSSIBILITY  OF  SUCH  DAMAGES. 
                      NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE IN THE AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, THE MAXIMUM 
                      AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF NepalLink AND ANY OF ITS EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR AFFILIATES, 
                      UNDER ANY THEORY OF LAW (INCLUDING BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY,<br>
                      AND INFRINGEMENT)  SHALL  BE A PAYMENT OF MONEY NOT TO EXCEED THE AMOUNT 
                      PAYABLE BY CUSTOMER FOR THREE MONTHS OF SERVICE. <br>
                      <br>
                      <strong>10. Suspension/Termination</strong><br>
                      <br>
                      Suspension of Service:Customer agrees that NepalLink may suspend services to the customer  with a 
                      prior  notice of  Ninety  Days  (90)  and without  liability  if:  (i)  NepalLink  reasonably believes  that  the 
                      services are being used in violation of the AUP; (ii) Customer fails to cooperate with any reasonable 
                      investigation  of  any  suspected  violation  of  the  AUP;  (iii)  NepalLink  reasonably  believes  that  the 
                      suspension of service is necessary to protect its network or its other customers, or (iv) as requested by 
                      a law enforcement or regulatory agency. <br>
                      <br>
                      <strong>Termination:</strong>The Agreement may be terminated by Customer prior to the expiration of the initial term or 
                      any renewal term with 15 days prior notice and without liability if NepalLink fails in a material way to 
                      provide the service in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and does not cure the failure within 
                      ten (10) days of Customer's written notice describing the failure in reasonable detail.  The agreement 
                      may be terminated by NepalLink prior to the expiration of the initial term or any renewal term without 
                      further notice and without liability as follows: (i) upon fifteen (15) days notice if Customer is overdue on<br>
                      the payment  of  any amount  due under  the agreement;  (ii)  Customer  materially violates any other 
                      provision of the agreement, including the AUP, and fails to cure the violation within Thirty (30) days of a 
                      written notice from NepalLink describing the violation in reasonable detail;  (iii)  upon  thirty (30)  days 
                      notice if Customer's service is used in violation of a material term of the AUP more than once, or (iv) 
                      upon  thirty  days  (30)  days  notice  if  Customer  violates  Section  6  (Customer  Information)  of  this 
                      agreement. Either party may terminate this agreement upon ninety days (90) days advance notice if the<br>
                      other party admits insolvency, makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, files for bankruptcy 
                      or similar protection, is unable to pay debts as they become due, has a trustee or receiver appointed 
                      over  all  or  a  substantial  portion  of  its  assets,  or  enters  into  an  agreement  for  the  extension  or 
                      readjustment of all or substantially all of its obligations.<br>
                      <br>
                      <strong>11. Request for Customer Information </strong><br>
                      <br>
                      Customer  agrees  that  NepalLink  may,  without  notice  to  Customer,  (i)  report  to  the  appropriate 
                      authorities any conduct  by Customer  or  any of  Customer's customers or  end users that  NepalLink 
                      believes violates applicable law, and (ii) provide any information that it has about Customer or any of its 
                      customers  or  end  users  in  response  to  a  formal  or  informal  request  from a  law enforcement  or 
                      regulatory agency or  in response to a formal  request  in a civil  action that  on its  face meets  the<br>
                      requirements for such a request.<br>
                      <br>
                      <strong>                      12. SERVICE GUARANTEES; DATA BACKUP</strong><br>
                      <br>
                      <strong>a) Service Guarantees</strong><br>
                      <br>
                      NepalLink guarantees 99.9% network uptime and server  stability.  This,  however,  does not  refer  to 
                      problems stemming from Server Hardware Breakdown, User error(s) or purposeful interruption(s) of the 
                      user service (e.g.  if  the client  shuts his/her own server down,  the Provider is not  responsible for the 
                      downtime), Failure due to software that is not explicitly supported by the Provider. If a hardware crash 
                      provoked by the Customer consequently happens, the Provider is beyond the control and responsibility 
                      for the resulting downtime.<br>
                      <strong><br>
                      b) Backup Policy</strong><br>
                      <br>
                      For the data backup of all website contents and databases, the responsibility lies upon both the parties<br>

                      <strong>15. Governing Law/Disputes <br>
                      <br>
                      </strong>The Agreement  shall  be governed by the laws of  the State of  Washington and Nepal  Government, 
                      exclusive of its choice of law principles, and the laws of the United States of America, as applicable. 
                      The agreement shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of 
                      Goods.  </p>
                    <p>EXCLUSIVE VENUE FOR ALL  DISPUTES ARISING OUT  OF  OR RELATING TO THE 
                      AGREEMENT SHALL BE THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS IN MERRIMACK COUNTY,  NEW<br>
                      HAMPSHIRE,  AND EACH PARTY AGREES NOT TO DISPUTE SUCH PERSONAL JURISDICTION 
                      AND WAIVES ALL OBJECTIONS THERETO.<br>
                      <br>
                      <strong>16. Miscellaneous <br>
                      </strong><br>
                      Each party acknowledges and agrees that the other party retains exclusive ownership and rights in its 
                      trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, inventions, copyrights, and other intellectual property. Neither 
                      party may use the other party's name or trade mark without the other party's prior written consent. The 
                      parties intend for their relationship to be that  of  independent  contractors and not  a partnership,  joint 
                      venture, or employer/employee. Neither party will represent itself to be agent of the other. Each party 
                      acknowledges that it has no power or authority to bind the other on any agreement and that it will not 
                      represent to any person that it has such power or authority. This Agreement may be amended only by a<br>
                      formal  written agreement  signed by both parties.  The terms on Customer's purchase order  or other 
                      business forms are not  binding on NepalLink unless they are expressly incorporated into a formal 
                      written agreement signed by both parties.  A party's failure or delay in enforcing any provision of the 
                      Agreement will not be deemed a waiver of that party's rights with respect to that provision or any other 
                      provision of the Agreement. A party's waiver of any of its right under the Agreement is not a waiver of 
                      any of its other rights with respect to a prior, contemporaneous or future occurrence, whether similar in<br>
                      nature or not. The captions in the Agreement are not part of the Agreement, but are for the convenience 
                      of the parties. The following provisions will survive expiration or termination of the Agreement: Fees, 
                      indemnity  obligations,  provisions  limiting  liability  and  disclaiming  warranties,  provisions  regarding 
                      ownership of  intellectual  property,  these miscellaneous provisions,  and other provisions that  by their 
                      nature are intended to survive termination of the Agreement. There are no third party beneficiaries to 
                      the Agreement.  Neither  insurers nor  the customers of  resellers are third party beneficiaries to the 
                      Agreement.  Customer  may not  transfer  the Agreement  without  NepalLink 's prior  written consent. 
                      NepalLink  's  approval  for  assignment  is  contingent  on  the  assignee  meeting  NepalLink  's  credit 
                      approval criteria. NepalLink may assign the Agreement in whole or in part. 
                      This Agreement together with the Order and AUP constitutes the complete and exclusive agreement 
                      between the parties regarding its subject matter and supersedes and replace any prior understanding or<br>
                      communication, written or oral. </p>
                    <p> 17.   NepalLink reserves the right  to remove permission to access the Service if  we suspect  security 
                      violation attempts involving your account, whether directly deliberately caused by you or not.                      </p>
                    <p>18. This agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of EU, US or 
                      Nepal.  In  the  event  that  any  portion  of  this  Agreement  is  held  to  be  unenforceable,  the 
                      unenforceable  portion  shall  be  construed  in  accordance  with  applicable  law as  nearly  as 
                      possible to reflect the original intentions of the parties and the remainder of the provisions shall<br>
                      remain in full force and effect. <br>
                      <br>
                      19. NepalLink Network reserves the right to change this Term of Service at any time. Changes shall 
                      become  effective  within  thirty  (30)  days  of  publication  of  the  revised  version  on 
                      www.NepalLink.net. Your continued use of your subscription after expiry of the 30-day period 
                      shall constitute your acceptance to be bound by the terms and conditions of the revised Term of<br>
                      Service.</p></td>
