<b>What is the full path to my cgi-bin?</b><br>

<b>Which folder do I load my web pages to?</b><br>
You should place all of your web documents in the public_html directory.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>I keep getting errors when trying to publish with Frontpage?</b><br>
The most common problem is not using the full url when uploading your site. Make 
sure you use the entire http://www.domain.com in the address you are attempting 
to publish to.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Can I have CGI outside of the bin?</b><br>
Yes, CGI will function in the yourdomain.com folder.<br>

<b>I've uploaded my site and still see &quot;placeholder for ...&quot;?</b><br>
You are still seeing the default index.php page set up when you ordered your 
hosting plan through us. Make sure to delete that old index.php page, then your 
site should resolve correctly.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>How long does it take for my DNS changes to update world wide?</b><br>
Normally you can expect to see your web site DNS to change within 24 hours once 
you have made the modifications at your registrar. However, we have seen it take 
up to 7 days in some cases where registrars and ISPs are a little slower.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Why isn't my SSI working?</b><br>
In order for SSI to be executed, you must rename all of your web pages to .shtml 
rather than .htm or .php. This solves the majority of SSI errors.<br>
